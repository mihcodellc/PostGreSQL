--Cleanup unused and redundant indexes â€“ DO & UNDO migration DDL

-- Use it to generate a database migration (e.g. RoR's db:migrate or Sqitch)
-- to drop unused and redundant indexes.

-- This query generates a set of `DROP INDEX` statements, that
-- can be used in your migration script. Also, it generates
-- `CREATE INDEX`, put them to revert/rollback migration script.

-- It is also a good idea to manually double check all indexes being dropped.
-- WARNING here: when you are dropping an index B which is redundant to some index A,
-- check that you don't drop the A itself at the same time (it can be in "unused").
-- So if B is "redundant" to A and A is "unused", the script will suggest
-- dropping both. If so, it is probably better to drop B and leave A.
-- -- in this case there is a chance that A will be used. If it will still be unused,
-- you will drop it during the next cleanup routine procedure.

-- This query doesn't need any additional extensions to be installed
-- (except plpgsql), and doesn't create anything (like views or smth)
-- -- so feel free to use it in your clouds (Heroku, AWS RDS, etc)

-- It also does't do anything except reading system catalogs and
-- printing NOTICEs, so you can easily run it on your
--  production *master* database.
-- (Keep in mind, that on replicas, the whole picture of index usage
-- is usually very different from master).
