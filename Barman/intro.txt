 Open Source Tool.
      2) Remote backup and restore of multiple Servers.
      3) Backup catalogs.
      4) Incremental backup is possible.
      5) You can define retention policies.
      6) Archiving and compression of Wal files and backup files.
      7) Support both rsync or postgresql protocols.

Barman supports different backup and WAL archive strategies, two of the most commonly used architectures.
  *Streaming backups with WAL streaming: uses the Postgres streaming replication protocol for both backups and WAL archiving = backup_method = postgres
  *Rsync backups with WAL archiving: relies on Rsync and SSH connections for transferring backup and WAL files to your Barman server = backup_method = rsync
